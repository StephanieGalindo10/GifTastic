# GifTastic

For this project, I will use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. For this example it can be pokemon or any character. To finish this task, I call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of my site.


Inspirations: As a big fan of the series Pokemon I wanted to setup my game and let the user choose thier pokemon using gifs.
